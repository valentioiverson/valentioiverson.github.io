I like mathematics and problem solving a lot -- and that's probably reflected a lot in my involvement in math contest throughout the years


Teaching & Achievements
=========
I have been active in math contest as a participant since. Some of my notable past achievements include: 
- Absolute Winner, Indonesia National Math Olympiad 2019
- Honorable Mention, Romanian Master of Mathematics 2020
- Bronze Medal, Asia Pacific Mathematics Olympiad 2020
- Bronze Medal, Tuymaada International Olympiad 2020
- Top 500, the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition
- Bronze Medal, Iranian Geometry Olympiad 2018 and 2019
- Second Prize, European Mathematical Cup 2020 

I also propose problems on KTO Matematika, an Indonesia nonprofit math olympiad community founded by Indonesian math olympiad alumni. 
I was also the head of KTOM, and nowadays ocassionally problem proposal and do some quality checking as well. 

Nowadays, I also help the Indonesian IMO team for various tasks like quality check, grading and problem proposing to help in part of the major national Indonesian math olympiads for IMO team selection. 
I am open to teaching, you can inquire me through my email. 





Problem Proposals
=========
Here is a selection of some of my past problem proposals


<div class="problem-box">
    <div class="problem-title">IMO 2024/2</div>
    <div class="problem-body">
    Determine all pairs $(a,b)$ of positive integers for which there exist positive integers $g$ and $N$ such that 
    \[ \gcd(a^n + b, b ^n + a) = g \]
    holds for all integers $n \ge N$.     
    </div>

    <div class="problem-title">IMO 2024/2 (N4)</div>
    <div class="problem-body">
    Determine all pairs $(a,b)$ of positive integers for which there exist positive integers $g$ and $N$ such that 
    \[ \gcd(a^n + b, b ^n + a) = g \]

<div class="problem-box">
    <div class="problem-title">IMO Shortlist 2022 A6</div>
    <div class="problem-body">
    Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the set of real numbers. We denote by $\mathcal{F}$ the set of all functions $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that 
    \[ f(x+f(y)) = f(x) + f(y) \]
    for every $x, y\in \mathbb{R}$. Find all rational numbers $q$ such that for every function $f \in \mathcal{F}$, there exists some $z \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(z) = qz$.

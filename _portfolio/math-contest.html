  <p>I like math and problem solving -- and thus I often do math contests and propose problems to make them more challenging. Here's an example of a math problem:</p>

  <p>Consider the following equation:</p>
  <p>
    \( x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \)
  </p>
  
  <p>Where \( x, y, z \) are integers, and the task is to find all the Pythagorean triples. This is a classic problem in number theory.</p>
  
  <p>The solution can be derived using:</p>
  <p>
    \( a = m^2 - n^2, \quad b = 2mn, \quad c = m^2 + n^2 \)
  </p>
  <p>Where \( m \) and \( n \) are integers, and \( m > n \). This formula generates all primitive Pythagorean triples.</p>

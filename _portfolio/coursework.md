Here's a list of university-level courses I’ve taken at the University of Waterloo, along with some I’ve self-studied or audited. Auditing means I followed along independently—using course materials, attending or watching lectures, and doing assignments—without formal grades. I’m planning to add notes for some courses when I get the chance, so stay tuned!

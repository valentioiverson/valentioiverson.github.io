Below is a list of relevant university-level coursework I have completed at the University of Waterloo, including courses I have self-studied or audited. Auditing typically involved following the course independently, following past or current course materials, sitting in or watch lectures, and completing assignments, though without receiving formal grades. I may have attached notes to some of the courses (will do so once I have more time).

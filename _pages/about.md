## About Me

Hi! I'm **Valentio Iverson**, a fourth-year undergraduate at the University of Waterloo, majoring in Computer Science with minors in Combinatorics & Optimization and Pure Mathematics. Originally from Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia, I'm passionate about mathematical methods in data science and machine learning. I actively pursue research problems that spark my curiosity and plan to begin graduate studies in machine learning theory in 2026 (expected B.S. May 2026).

Check out my [Math](/math/) page for cool math content like contest handouts, problem proposals, and university coursework projects or notes.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and theoretical computer science, with a focus on machine learning theory. More broadly, I am also interested in theoretical computer science and other math topics like number theory, combinatorics and discrete geometry. 

## News

- **May 2025**: Paper *"Optimal Differentially Private Sampling of Unbounded Gaussians"* accepted to TPDP 2025.
- **March 2025**: Featured in [Waterloo's news](https://uwaterloo.ca/math/news/waterloo-ranks-sixth-putnam-competition) for the University of Waterloo's 6th-place ranking in the 2024 Putnam Competition as a team member.
- **February 2025**: Awarded Honorable Mention in the 2024 William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition.

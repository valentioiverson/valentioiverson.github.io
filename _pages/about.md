## About Me

Hi! I'm **Valentio Iverson**, a fourth-year undergraduate at the University of Waterloo, majoring in Computer Science with minors in Combinatorics & Optimization and Pure Mathematics. Originally from Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia, I am driven by a passion for advancing mathematical foundations in data science and machine learning. I aim to begin a graduate studies in machine learning theory in 2026 (expected B.S. May 2026).

Beyond my research, I enjoy engaging with the mathematical community through math contests. Iâ€™m particularly proud of proposing Problem 2 for the IMO 2024 (the first IMO problem from Indonesia!) and earning an Honorable Mention in the 2024 William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. 

Check out my [Math](/math/) page for resources like contest handouts, problem proposals, and coursework projects and notes, or my [Blog Posts](/blog/) for some cool blog posts on mathematics, most likely contest math and machine learning topics.


## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and theoretical computer science, with a focus on machine learning theory. More broadly, I am also interested in theoretical computer science and other math topics like number theory, combinatorics and discrete geometry. 

You can check out my [Research & Publications](/research/) page to learn more about my research interests and recent publications.

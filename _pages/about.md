## About Me

Hi! I'm **Valentio Iverson**, a fourth-year undergraduate at the University of Waterloo, majoring in Computer Science with minors in Combinatorics & Optimization and Pure Mathematics. Originally from Medan, North Sumatra, Indonesia, I am driven by a passion for advancing mathematical foundations in data science and machine learning. I plan to pursue graduate studies in machine learning theory starting in 2026 (expected B.S. June 2026).

Beyond my research, I enjoy engaging with the mathematical community through math contests. Iâ€™m particularly proud of proposing **Problem 2 for the IMO 2024** (the first IMO problem from Indonesia) and earning an **Honorable Mention** in the 2024 William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. 

Check out my [Math](/math/) page for resources like contest handouts, problem proposals, and coursework projects and notes, or my [Blog Posts](/blog/) for some cool blog posts on mathematics, most likely contest math and machine learning topics.


## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and theoretical computer science, with a focus on theoretical foundations of machine learning. More broadly, I am also interested in theoretical computer science and other math topics like number theory, combinatorics and discrete geometry. My ambitious research goal is to develop provable explanation and guarantees to various machine learning phenomenon.

You can check out my [Research & Publications](/research/) page to learn more about my research interests and recent publications.

<p>My primary research interests focus on mathematical methods in data science and machine learning, bridging classical areas like computational learning theory and modern advancements in deep learning theory. More specifically, my current research interest lies on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning Theory</strong>: contrastive learning and domain adaptation</li>
  <li><strong>Statistics</strong>: differentially private fundamental statistical learning algorithms</li>
  <li><strong>Deep Learning Theory</strong>: algorithmic guarantees on deep learning models and algorithms.</li>
  <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning Theory</strong>: online learning, multi-armed bandits, and game theory for agent-based learning.</li>
  <li><strong>Optimization in Machine Learning</strong>: optimization problems in training or machine learning</li>
  <li><strong>Algorithms in Data Science</strong>: efficient algorithm for data science problems</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond my primary focus, I have also worked on other fields that pique my interest, including asymptotic density work in number theory, graph theory, theoretical computer science, and deep learning in speech processing.</p>

<p>Please reach out to me if you would like to collaborate. I am very interested in collaborating on similar research projects.</p>

$$ \gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a) $$
is eventually constant. So will $(1,1)$ work? 

Imagine you want to compute the area under a tricky curve, like $f(x) = \sin(x^2)$, from $x = 0$ to $x = 1$. Analytically, it’s a mess. Monte Carlo makes it simple:

1. Generate random points $(x, y)$ in a rectangle containing the curve (e.g., $x \in [0, 1]$, $y \in [0, 1]$).
2. Check if each point lies below the curve ($y \leq f(x)$).
3. The fraction of points below the curve, multiplied by the rectangle’s area, approximates the integral.

Mathematically, if you sample $N$ points and $M$ fall below the curve, the area is roughly:

$$
\text{Area} \approx \frac{M}{N} \cdot \text{Rectangle Area}
$$

As $N$ grows, the approximation gets better, thanks to the law of large numbers.

## Why Are They Cool?

Monte Carlo methods shine in high-dimensional problems, like those in machine learning or physics. For example:

- **Bayesian Inference**: Estimating posterior distributions in probabilistic models.
- **Optimization**: Approximating gradients in complex loss landscapes.
- **Physics Simulations**: Modeling particle interactions in statistical mechanics.

The catch? They can be slow to converge (think $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ error), but their simplicity and flexibility make them a go-to tool.

## A Fun Example

Suppose you want to estimate $\pi$ using Monte Carlo. Draw a unit square ($1 \times 1$) and a quarter-circle inside it (radius 1, centered at $(0, 0)$). Generate random points in the square and count how many fall inside the quarter-circle. Since the quarter-circle’s area is $\pi/4$, the ratio of “hits” to total points, multiplied by 4, approximates $\pi$:

$$
\pi \approx 4 \cdot \frac{\text{Points inside quarter-circle}}{\text{Total points}}
$$
